# Project Overview for Bird Identifier App

This repository is for the analysis and modeling done with a bird images dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal was to create an end-to-end project where I create a pipeline to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA), image augmentation, create a convolution neural network to predict birds, and create a deployed application with a front-end to productionize the neural network.

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.7.10 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, flask<br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  

## Bird Images Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). The dataset contains 275 different birds and .

### Birds

`age`, `sex`,`cp`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `thalach`, `exang`, `oldpeak`, `slope`, `ca`, `thal`

## Productionization

I built a front-end to run on my local machine which takes photos of birds as input from the user and outputs a bird prediction using a convolution neural network.
